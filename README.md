**Work in progress** 🚧: The **INTERFACER** project is a **EU EFRE**-funded project where four partners - **HSU, FCHH, Dyne.org** and **HIWW** teamed up to develop, test, publish and run the **Fab City OS** and collaborate on related issues, e.g. 
promoting circular design or improving the **Open Source Hardware** tool chain. The Interfacer GUI is
based on the <a href="https://www.valueflo.ws/">**ValueFlows vocabularies**</a> implementing REA (resource-event-agent) based economic 
flows in distributed economic ecosystems. Furthermore, the outcome resource has a first POC of a Digital Product Passport, tracking all the resources, events and agents involved in its production.
